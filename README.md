<h1 align="center"><u><b>Car Shop Management System</b></u></h1>

```
Chapter: 01 (Introduction)
```
The **Car Shop Management System** is a computer-based application that helps a car
showroom run its business more smoothly. It allows customers to sign up, log in, see the
available cars, and place orders. After a customer orders a car, the manager can handle the
payment. Customers can also check their order history and payment status. Admins have full
control over the system. They can add or remove managers, view customer and manager
details, manage car information, and check all orders and payments. The system helps keep
everything organized and saves time by reducing manual work.
Key features of the system include:

- **User Management** for Admins, Managers, and Customers.
- **Car Browsing and Ordering** for customers to explore and order cars.
- **Order and Payment Tracking** to keep records of orders and payments.
- **Manager Panel** to handle customer orders and payments.
- **Sales Report** to view monthly business performance.
The system is built using C# and SQL Server. It uses a well-organized database that keeps all
the information safe, accurate, and easy to find. This system makes it easier for the car shop to
provide fast and reliable service to its users.
